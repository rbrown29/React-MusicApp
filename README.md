### Original Goal
<p>This app was designed to add and delete music to a database. Users can also favorite a song, rate a song, and remove a song from favorites list.</p>

### Technologies Used:
1. React - Frontend
2. PHP - Backend
3. PostgreSQL - Database
4. JSX
5. CSS

### Approach Taken
<p>Our goal with this app was to design an interface for users to access a database of music and be able to favorite songs of their choosing. They then can access their favorite songs and rate them accordingly</p>

### Challenges
<p>Our biggest challenge was learning how to deploy both an API backend as well as a React frontend and then connect the two. Besides just establishing a connection to our backend we also had to make sure that each of us had the correct permissions in order to access the data. Once we established deployment on both sides of our app we were able to access the database and seemlessly manipulate the data.  Once we got passed the initial deployments we were smoothe sailing and our app was fully functional</p>

### Potential Future Plans
<p> Replace our manually built database with a fully functional third party API so we have access to much more music</p>
